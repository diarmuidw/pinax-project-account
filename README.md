Django on Gondor
================

This Django project is a very simple example that will work out-of-the-box on
Gondor. You can use this to start your project that will be hosted on Gondor.

Usage
=====

Create a virtual environment (see `virtualenv`_) and install Django::

    pip install Django==1.4.2

Now you are ready to start your Django project. Use ``startproject`` to get
this template.

pinax-project-account
=====================

a starter project the incorporates account features from django-user-accounts
and integrates with gondor

Usage:

    django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/diarmuidw/pinax-project-account/zipball/master <project_name>


To make this project runnable you will need to install its dependencies in
your virtual environment.

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
You might get an error with the postgress install but you can comment that lines out

#psycopg2==2.4.5

Make sure to uncomment it when deploying to Gondor so that your database will run!
